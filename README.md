The goal was to explore machine learning tasks in the context of a real-world data set using big data analysis tools. It covered the followng:

1.Exploratory Data Analysis 
2.Prediction using tree ensemble methods
3.Collaborative filtering for recommendation 
4.Topic modeling for text reviews 
5.Word2Vec for text reviews
6.Frequent pattern mining using FP-Growth algorithm 

Disclaimer - We worked on a subset of the Yelp academic dataset because of techincal challenges.
